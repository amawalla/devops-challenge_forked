# DevOps Challenge

We think infrastructure is best represented as code and should automate the provisioning of resources as much as possible. In order to assess a candidate's ability to perform hands-on DevOps tasks, we provide the following exercise.

We are testing your ability to implement modern automated infrastructure, as well as your general knowledge of system administration and coding. Your solution should emphasize readability, maintainability, and DevOps methodologies.

To begin, create a public repository with any VC of your choice and start adding your work. Commit often, we would rather see a history of trial and error than a single monolithic push. When you're finished, send us the URL to your repository.

## The rules

- Read and understand The challenge(s).
- Create a solution that satisfies the requirements given.
- Send the link to the VC repository containing your solution to the person who contacted you.

## The challenge

- Fork this repository to your VC account
- Complete each challenge in whatever order you want, at whatever pace you want.
- Be as complex or as simple as you want, and use whatever language you want. Sometimes we are looking for complex code solutions, other times we are not. The language used is not really a point of concern.
- It is okay to rely on other existing frameworks, libraries, or tools to accomplish goals. If you can do the same task with less code by just gluing some existing things together, that will make us very happy. Don't feel like you have to reinvent the wheel!
- Documented solutions are better than undocumented ones
- Solutions with good, useful tests are better than solutions without good, useful tests
- Add a README on your solution,
- Above all, your solutions must run. If it is okay for a solution to not run, or to be untested, the README in that project will note such.
- When you are done with the challenges, send a Pull Request, and we'll get back to you

# Questions

#### What scripting languages can I use?

Anyone you like. You'll have to justify your decision. We use PHP, Python, nodejs, Ruby and Rails, ReactJS, and .Net (amongst others) internally. Please pick something you're familiar with, as you'll need to be able to discuss it.

#### Will I have to pay for the AWS charges?

No. You are expected to use free-tier resources only and not generate any charges. Please remember to delete your resources once the review process is over so you are not charged by AWS.

#### What will you be grading me on?

Scripting skills, elegance, maintainability, understanding of the technologies you use, security, and in case you missed it....documentation! We don't want to know if you can do exactly as asked (or if everybody would have the same result). We want to know what you bring to the table when working on a project, and what is your secret sauce. More features? Best solution? Thinking outside the box? Hint: we would like to be able to test this outside of the environment you create, so make it reusable

#### Will I have a chance to explain my choices?

Feel free to comment on your code, or ideally put explanations in a pull request within the repo in one or more readme files We'll discuss the choices you made at the interview.

#### Why doesn't the challenge include X?

Good question. Feel free to tell us how to make the test better. Or, you know, fork it and improve it!

#### How long should this take?

There are many ways to solve these challenges, so it may vary for each candidate and depends on how far you want to take it, but we are confident the basic requirements can be met with 1-2 hours of work for each challenge.
